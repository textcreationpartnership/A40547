            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  </gap>ſoner to the Caſtle,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61717:2"/> And <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> taking his part, by ſtrenouſly arguing the Caſe with King <hi>JAMES,</hi> put him into ſo great a paſſion, that extorted this Expreſſion from him: <hi>And will you turn Rebel alſo, and diſpute my Commands?</hi> and then gave Order for his immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment alſo.</p>
               <p>They add, That the <hi>French</hi> are very inſolent and rude to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, eſpecially to the Women-kind; towards whom, they act their Parts like Death, ſparing none; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young Women, nor old, dare walk the Streets, or ſcare peep out of doors for them: And being on free Quarter, they devour all the poor Proteſtants have left. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Jervice</hi> had Thirty quartered on him, notwithſtanding the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, when he romoved from his Houſe to Sir <hi>John Davis</hi>'s, took all the Alderman's Goods from him.</p>
               <p>They add alſo, That King <hi>JAMES</hi> having ſeized all the Corn, and brought it into Granaries of his own: Paid ſome in Braſs Money, and others he has given Tickets to be paid, as faſt as the Braſs Money can be made: And for all the Corn, he gives but a ſmall rate; and now he ſells it out, to the Owners thereof, at treble the price, and will not take Braſs Money, but be paid in Silver, or Gold; ſo that they who cannot get Silver, or Gold, to buy Bread, muſt be ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; though he pays nothing but Braſs Money amongſt them. By this means, King <hi>JAMES</hi> will get all the Silver and Gold that's left, in his Quarters; for he forces the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as well as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to buy at this rate, deſigning to lay up, what he gets this way, in bank in <hi>France,</hi> to keep him when he's deſerted of all: For 'tis generally thought his oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and tyranny, will, in a little time, make the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (though for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly his Dear Joys, and Guardian Angels) weary of him; and the <hi>French</hi> King, when he can be no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerviceable to him, will caſt him by like an old Almanack.</p>
               <p>They add likewiſe, That the <hi>Iriſh</hi> have deſerted the Towns of <hi>Ardee Dundalk,</hi> and <hi>Carlingford,</hi> on which, his Grace the Duke of <hi>Schonberg</hi> has ordered a Regiment of Horſe, and a Party of Dragoons, to take poſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now the Caſtle of <hi>Bellingargy</hi> is taken, there is but one Paſs more in thoſe parts, which is that of <hi>Fina,</hi> which is a ſtrong Paſs, ſtill poſſeſt by the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> which being once reduced, will open a clear way into the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Connaught,</hi> which will be quickly over-run, there being but few Places of any ſtrength in that Province.
